# Redd.it

A reddit clone using React 18, tailwind and material-ui.
It is mostly a client application because i probably will not continue the project after its realease date so im just coding a solid base, the cleaner and the faster as possible.

A solid architecture should looks like an application that request an API to interact with the database to make sure data is properly processed
and to grant authorizations.

> A short api has still been developped to make sure registering new users is safe whatever happen client side. Please contact me if you need the code to runs it properly
